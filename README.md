This is a fork of this [app](https://github.com/trailheadapps/ecars): 

# Local Dev

- npm run build
- npm run serve
# How to start?
Start simple by running yarn watch (or npm run watch, if you set up the project with npm). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the src folder. All web components are within the src/client/modules folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components. The entry file for the custom Express configuration can be found in the 'src/server' folder.
